[James Ward](https://twitter.com/_JamesWard) from Typesafe joined us after presenting with [Nicolas Leroux](https://twitter.com/nicolasleroux) (Lunatech) at Devoxx UK and Devoxx FR last week. [Roland Kuhn](https://twitter.com/rolandkuhn), Akka tech lead at Typesafe, travelled from Sweden.

James and Nicolas live-coded a Play framework application that used the meetup.com API to select a competition winner from the list of attendees. [Robert Bakker](http://www.meetup.com/010DEV/members/68836872/) won a free place on the [Fast Track to Play with Scala](http://lunatech.com/training/play-2-training) training course at Lunatech on 30-31 May 2013.

Locus Publicus remains a popular choice of venue, with the facilities this kind of event needs: a projector, a bar and a great beer selection. For this event, Lunatech sponsored the beer.

Although we created [010DEV](http://010dev.nl) to be a community of Rotterdam-based developers, this event attracted people from further afield, including five developers who travelled from Belgium.
