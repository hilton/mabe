Typesafe provides a variety of training courses on Typesafe stack technologies,
together with Typesafe partners in different countries. The [Fast Track To Play
With Scala](http://typesafe.com/training/fasttracktoplaywithscala) course has 
previously been given in San Francisco, New York, London and Zurich. This year,
we’re adding Rotterdam to the list.

# Play training at Lunatech

This year, Lunatech has become a Typesafe training partner and will provide
Typesafe’s Play framework training course. The first course is at our Rotterdam
office at the end of May.

This is a two-day course that teaches the practical skills you need to build a
web application with Play and Scala. The course is an excellent way to get up to
speed with Play for your next project and is also an opportunity to learn to
apply basic Scala programming skills.

If you want to train several developers in your organisation, we can also
provide this course on-site in your office, on-request. Please contact us for
details.

# Win a place on the course

Next week, Lunatech is going to give away a place on the 30-31 May Play
framework training course. The training course place will be the prize in a
contest at next Tuesday’s [010DEV](http://010dev.nl) event.

The [010DEV Typesafe Night](http://010dev.nl/post/social-tech-event-typesafe-night-010dev) 
event includes a Play framework presentation by James Ward (Typesafe) and
Nicolas Leroux (Lunatech), as well as an Akka presentation by Akka tech lead
Roland Kuhn (Typesafe).

There is only one training course place to give away, but the runner-up prize is
of course free beer for everyone else who attends.
